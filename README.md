# strcmp.js

Some string comparison functions which have been written to help me grok the algorithms.  If you are after this kind of thing and more natural language goodness, I'd recommend checking out [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) (although I think the  [Jaro-Winkler distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance) implementation is broken at the moment).

At the moment, check out the tests for example usage.
